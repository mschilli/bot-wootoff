NAME
    Bot::WootOff - Poll woot.com during a woot-off and notify via IRC

SYNOPSIS
        use Bot::WootOff;

        my $bot = Bot::WootOff->new(
            server  => "irc.freenode.net",
            channel => "#wootoff",
        );

        $bot->run();

DESCRIPTION
    Bot::WootOff periodically polls woot.com during a woot-off and sends
    messages to in IRC channel to alert the user of new items.

    What, you don't know what woot.com is? It's a site that sells one item a
    day at a discounted price. Once the item is sold out, the site runs idle
    for the rest of the day. But every once in a while, it switches into a
    mode called woot-off, where it keeps popping up new items as soon as the
    lot of the previous item is sold. This is called a "Woot Off", and it's
    something many people are looking forward to, as all items, and most of
    all, the legendary "Bag of Crap", can be had a bargain price. If you
    think all of this is silly, move on to the next CPAN module! Nice
    meeting you! If you're a bargain hunter, continue reading.

    If you notice that there's a woot-off going on on woot.com, simply start
    your bot via the 'wootbot' script included in this module, like

        wootbot -s irc.freenote.net -c '#wootoff'

    or use the perl code in the SYNOPSIS section of this document. The bot
    will start up, connect to the IRC server, and log into the channel
    specified. It'll start polling woot.com in 30-second intervals until the
    next item in the woot-off will be presented. At this point, it will post
    a short item description to the IRC channel to alert the user of the
    buying opportunity:

        Trying to connect to server irc.freenode.net
        Trying to connect to '#wootoff0538'
        2009/05/13 23:17:36 Requesting http://www.woot.com
        2009/05/13 23:17:36 Apple 8GB 4th Gen iPod Nano posted to #wootoff0538

    The above output can be seen if you start "wootbot" in verbose mode,
    using the "-v" option. It also prints status messages like

        2009/05/13 23:36:23 Requesting http://www.woot.com
        2009/05/13 23:36:24 Nothing changed
        2009/05/13 23:36:54 Requesting http://www.woot.com
        2009/05/13 23:36:54 Nothing changed

    to STDOUT in regular intervals to let the user know what it's doing.
    When it posts messages to the IRC channel specified, it will use the
    nickname "wootbot" (unless you specify another nickname in the
    constructor). The messages will look like

        (11:41:29 PM) wootbot: Forever Flashlight  III 4.99 http://www.woot.com
        (11:44:32 PM) wootbot: Deluxe Charades Game 2.99 http://www.woot.com

    Each message contains a link to woot.com, which will be displayed by IRC
    clients like Pidgin in a clickable format, so that you can reach the
    current offer with a single mouse click.

    If someone in the channel says "!woot" then the bot will repeat its last
    message. This is helpful if someone just joined the channel and wants to
    know what the current item is.

    All you have to do to receive these message is use an IRC client like
    Pidgin, connect to the IRC server specified (irc.freenode.net by
    default), log into the channel specified (#wootoffxxxx by default, where
    xxxx is a random number so that all of you script kiddies using this
    module won't step on other people's toes. Use a specific name like
    #wootoff to connect to the actual channel specified), and enjoy the
    incoming messages. Set up sounds and you'll be able to do useful work
    while being interrupted with the latest bargains.

    Extra tip: If your IRC window in Pidgin gets full and you want the
    visual interruption of an empty window being filled, use CTRL-L to clear
    the current window.

  Methods
    new()
        The constructor takes the following arguments:

            my $bot = Bot::WootOff->new(
              irc_server       => "irc.freenode.net",
              irc_channel      => "#wootoff",
              irc_nick         => "wootbot",
              http_agent       => (__PACKAGE__ . "/" . $VERSION),
              http_alias       => "wootoff-ua",
              http_timeout     => 60,
              http_url         => "http://www.woot.com",
              http_max_retries => 30,
              poll_interval    => 30,
              Alias            => "wootoff-bot",
              spawn            => 1,
            );

        Some of these parameters are specific to POE, the framework driving
        the bot.

    run()
        This methods starts the bot, which usually runs until the program is
        terminated.

EXAMPLES
